            <p>ACDS provides residential services for adults with developmental disabilities, age 21 and over, at 8 Individual Residential Alternatives (group homes) and one apartment, located in Wantagh, Merrick, Freeport, Seaford and Albertson, NY. The agency’s group homes enable the 54 residents we serve to leave their parents’ homes and live on their own as most young adults do. The staff at the group homes help the residents facilitate an independent life, providing supervision and support to assist them to increase their independence in all areas of their daily life.  These areas include: domestic skills, social interaction, travel, community orientation, recreation, personal finances, leisure time activities and the ability to make choices. </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Each resident’s program is individualized to help them become all that they can be by working towards outcomes that are important to the person and their family.  Some of ACDS’ residents began their relation with ACDS in our educational programs in early childhood. Many have also participated in our 5Plus recreation programs in the past (and continue to do so in age appropriate adult recreational and socialization programs).  These are just some examples of ACDS achieving its mission to be a lifetime agency.</p>

            <p>The apartment program, which has 2 residents, is a program that works with the residents to help them develop skills to hopefully enable them to live on their own in the future with minimum supervision and assistance.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>The Houses are staffed 24/7 with trained counselors and are each supervised by a manager. RNs provide medical oversight, supervision and training to all staff in the areas of medication administration and other health issues. The agency also employs a full-time Applied Behavior Specialist (ABS) to work with the residents on individual behavioral issues as well as issues associated with group home living.</p>
